        <p>This article by Salim Ansari is about how to improve user input websites so that they are easy to use and understand in 20 tips. Many of the tips provided were based in communication and making sure that the user is understanding what is being asked of them by the webpage. In many cases the design does not communicate the actions well and by doing simple changes we can improve these websites in the future. Tip number 5 is my favorite I think because I experience problems on websites where it is hard for me to understand what is actually required information. By actually typing out the word optional I think that it makes it way easier to understand. Another tip that I really hope to see more in user input design is using less and less drop down menus. I like the checkboxes much more because they make it easier to fill out forms on your phone. There are so many cases where I need to fill out a form on my phone and the drop down menu cuts off the endings of the options. It makes it very difficult to try and finish my forms. Something that I think is really understated in this article is the use of the tab key to move around the page. I use the tab key for convenience on my computer but sometimes it just doesn't work for certain forms. I assume that the tab key is also used for people with disabilities so I couldn’t imagine the frustration of having documents that I couldn’t use because of such a simple tabbing issue. </p>
