        <h1>Erika Nordman's Final Project Brief</h1>
        <h2>Project Summary</h2>
        <p>I am going to be taking my Every Picture project and making it more fun and interesting. Using some better colors, lively font, and design skills, I will be making the whole website more unified and attractive to users.</p>

        <h2>Comparison Project 1</h2>
        <a href="https://gismaps.bothellwa.gov/H5/index.html?viewer=COBMap&scale=72192"><img src="images/Screen Shot 2021-11-23 at 6.51.27 AM.png" alt="Website 1"></a>
        <p>Most map websites that I can find on the web are not set up to be very pretty. They take an incredible amount of time to load or are really clunky. They are meant to just show you a map and not really the places on the map that are nice to visit. Although I can find nice picture maps of places to visit, most of the maps that I look up aren't quite as well designed as the images. I don’t want users to drag around my map like they do google maps. I want them to have the map be big enough just to look and see and then click where they want to know more information. <br> Go to the <a href="https://gismaps.bothellwa.gov/H5/index.html?viewer=COBMap&scale=72192">website</a> mentioned above</p>

        <h2>Comparison Project 2</h2>
        <a href="https://nyclpc.maps.arcgis.com/apps/webappviewer/index.html?id=93a88691cace4067828b1eede432022b"><img src="images/Screen Shot 2021-11-23 at 6.56.54 AM.png" alt="Website 2"></a>
        <p>The second map that I found was not much better than the first. I tried to find maps that looked more like the references that I am using to redraw my map but anything that looks like the design that I am doing is not interactive. This map had a transparent overlay that popped up as soon as you got on the page which I think was unsuccessful because it seemed weird having the text and all be semi-transparent. Then they have these shapes that appear to be divs like how I have mine set up but they are just colorful. They don’t give you any idea of what you're clicking on until you click on it.<br> Go to the <a href="https://nyclpc.maps.arcgis.com/apps/webappviewer/index.html?id=93a88691cace4067828b1eede432022b">website</a> mentioned above. </p>

        <h2>Project Goals</h2>
        <P>I don’t like either one of these comparison projects so if I do a good job it will look nothing like either one of these. I want my map to be designed in a way that makes the user feel happy and interested when they look at my map, not just a random window of mint green texture. I don’t want my map to be just blank with the words “UC Davis” written across the middle. I want to have images and items on my map right away so that the user doesn't feel lost right off the bat.</P>

        <h2>Design Strategies</h2>
        <p>I think that I need to use a more interesting font for my letters and use better colors for both my map design and my CSS. I plan on refreshing these little design things in the CSS but also rethinking my map to improve it and make it look more refined. Then I plan on using a moving GIF as a mouse pointer instead of the static cow, that way I can make him change when the user hovers over clickable links. Then I plan on making more DIVs that the user can click on that will take them to that exact spot on street view of google maps. Finally I think my overlays are nice but could be improved and made to fit the overall design of the page more. The Colors in the overlay are saturated while the other colors are pastels and I think that it would look better if they were more similar. I also think that even though I used the same font for both the main page and the overlay, I used them in such different ways that they seem disconnected. I want to fix that and make them more harmonious. </p>

        <h2>Interaction Strategies</h2>
        <p>My interactions will all be based on clicks and overlays. The clicks will either lead you to a link on google map street view or it will take you to a specific overlay about the building the user has selected. </p>

        <h2>Experience goals</h2>
        <p>I don’t want my users to look at my website and think, “oh a map…”. Maps on the internet can be so boring and uninspiring and I want my map to at least be pretty. I want my users to see the design and be interested for merely a second on the contents of my map and maybe click on a few things. Final goal is an esthetically pleasing map with overlays that work.</p>
