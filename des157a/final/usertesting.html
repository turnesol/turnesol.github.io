        <h2>3 Significant Observations</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Almost all three of my users showed signs of difficulty with the google maps. They struggled with the maps opening into new tabs and then also getting back to the old tab with the rest of the website on it. I need to make the google map hotspots
                clearer for the users. People had a lot of difficulties trying to find the hotspots but also navigating around them when they opened in a new tab. The hotspot was meant to be easter eggs but that wasn’t communicated well so it left most
                of them confused. Also adding more might be helpful since many of them were looking for more hotspots.</li>
            <li>I need to reword my intro so that it is clearer that you need to look for the hotspots. The way that I worded it made it sound like you could just click on any street and it would take you there. Then the users spent a lot of their time clicking
                through all of the streets trying to get the google maps to open up. If I make it so that the years can see the hotspots before they hover then I think I might add the icon that google uses for their person because then people might understand
                that clicking on the little person would take you to street view. </li>
            <li>Even though there won't be the alert for the final project there was an issue of the divs showing up over the overlay which caused chaos the first testing round. I noticed that on my overlays there are a few hotspots that still show up above
                the overlays that I need to tweek. I can just change the z-index for the overlay so that there aren’t hotspots for the other buildings on the overlay.
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Solutions</h2>

        <p>I think I will try to embed the google maps page into the image so that people don’t get confused by the multiple tabs. Then I will also make it so that they can see the hotspots before they hover so that they are easier to find. Then I will make
            the intro clearer and adjust the z-index for my overlays. </p>
